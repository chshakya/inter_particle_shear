# inter_particle_shear
code to analyse data and generate figures for the paper "Viscoelastic material properties determine the contact mechanics of hydrogel spheres"
The code to anayze data from the be found  in the branch experiment_code.  The plots on the paper can be generated by main_script_particle_particle_shear.m section by section. The main processing and filtering of the dats is done in process.m
